# Fastlane-Swift-DSL
Repository using custom made DSL over fastlane-swift.

## The idea of this project
The idea is to show how you can create a custom lane with fastlane-swift `<laneName>WithoutDSL` and how to create the same lane with Fastlane-Swift-DSL `<laneName>`. That way we can show you that Fastlane-Swift-DSL syntax is way more understandable and pleasant.

## How to use Fastlane-Swift-DSL:
1. Create a new project.
2. In root directory terminal -> `fastlane init swift`
3. In fastlane/Fastfile define your own lanes using the new syntax (every lane's name should end with Lane).
